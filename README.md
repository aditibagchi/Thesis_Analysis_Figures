How to identifiy outliers in tumor samples? 
Step:1 Histogram demostrated that the distribution of samples was not normal, there was a lot of variability and outliers.
Step:2 to identify the outliers we generated a boxplot which showed that there are 9 outliers, which have TMD > ~ 4 mutations / Mb
Step3 : IQR and Q3 and Q1 was calculated. All tumors with TMD> 3.7 Mut/Mb were considered outleirs with higher than noral tumor mutational burden. 
We identified 9 samples that had TMD > 3.7Mut/Mb.
